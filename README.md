# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes student academic performance using a real-world dataset.
The aim is to understand how different factors such as gender and subject type
affect student scores.

## Dataset
The dataset contains student information including:
- Gender
- Race/Ethnicity
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type
- Test preparation course
- Math, Reading, and Writing scores

## Objectives
- Analyze overall student performance
- Compare average scores across subjects
- Study gender-wise performance differences
- Visualize results using simple graphs

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Key Insights
- Students scored higher in reading and writing compared to mathematics.
- Female students performed better in reading and writing.
- Male students showed slightly higher performance in mathematics.

## Conclusion
This project helped in understanding basic data analysis techniques and
interpreting insights from educational data.
